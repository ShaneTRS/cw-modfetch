Freakishly inefficient and stupid incompatibility checker
    It goes through every mod and checks for incompatibilities, even if the base mod it's checking for isn't even enabled
        This should only check for incompatiiblities for enabled mods
    It also updates the strikethrough status of *every* choice available on the GUI, not even just ones that can actually have incompatibilities
        This at the very least should only update the status of mods that can be incompatible with other mods

The download management is also freakishly inefficient and stupid
    Currently, it checks each mod to see if it should be downloaded
    It should instead add each file to a queue, and go through that instead
    Super optimistically, it could go through that queue asynchronously?
