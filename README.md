A simple AutoHotkey script that will hopefully help people install Cube World mods easily

The actual script is `cw-modfetch.ahk`
But there are three compiled versions in the `build` folder

It is worth mentioning that just like every other compiled script, this can set off false-positives for your anti-virus software.
The source code *is* available, so you can always compile it for yourself, or just run it as a standard script if you'd like.
