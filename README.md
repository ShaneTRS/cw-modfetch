This is a tool that will hopefully help people install Cube World mods easier!
It automatically grabs files from this repository, so you shouldn't have to update this tool very often, if at all.

It currently downloads the following each time it runs:
- Mod list (files and names)
- Mod incompatibilities
- GUI components (sections and buttons)

This tool only works with an internet connection, it is online-only.

The actual script is `cw-modfetch.ahk`
But there are three compiled versions in the `build` folder

It is worth mentioning that just like every other compiled script, this can set off false-positives for your anti-virus software.
The source code *is* available, so you can always compile it for yourself, or just run it as a standard script if you'd like.
